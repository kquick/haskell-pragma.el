* Overview

This package defines a minor mode for haskell-mode in emacs that provides a
[[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]] (i.e., a persistent keybinding).  The hydra allows for easy insertion of
Haskell ~LANGUAGE~ pragmas in two to three keystrokes each.  This can be handy
for modules requiring many language extensions to compile.  The minor mode sets
the hydra to be triggered by the ~C-c l~ only in haskell-mode.

The hydra includes a number of frequently-used extensions.  The ~o o~ keybinding
in the hydra allows for the insertion of extensions not in the default list.
